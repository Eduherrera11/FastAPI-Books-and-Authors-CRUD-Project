# FastAPI Books and Authors CRUD Project
<bh>
Welcome to my FastAPI project! This project demonstrates my proficiency in FastAPI and Python by implementing a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. The project uses a db.json file as a mock database to manage books and authors.


This project is a simple CRUD application for managing books and authors. It showcases good modularization practices in Python and FastAPI. The application is designed to be straightforward and efficient, making it a great example of how to use FastAPI for RESTful API development.

### Features
Create, read, update, and delete books
Create, read authors
Use of db.json as a mock database
Clear and organized code structure
Comprehensive error handling
Fast and efficient performance
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository.
Create and activate a virtual environment.
Install the dependencies.
Run the FastAPI application.
Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

### Endpoints
Here are the main endpoints available in the application:

**Books**
- GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books
- GET /books/{id}: Retrieve a book by its ID
- POST /books: Create a new book
- PUT /books/{id}: Update an existing book
- DELETE /books/{id}: Delete a book by its ID
**Authors**
- GET /authors: Retrieve a list of all authors
- GET /authors/{id}: Retrieve an author by their ID

### Preview
This project is a demonstration of how to build a fully functional CRUD application using FastAPI. By leveraging FastAPI's capabilities, I've created a modular and efficient system for managing books and authors. The use of a JSON file as a mock database allows for easy testing and development.

### Conclusion
In this project, I have demonstrated my ability to use FastAPI and Python to create a well-structured and functional CRUD application. The project covers all essential CRUD operations and showcases good practices in API development and modularization. I look forward to any feedback and suggestions to improve this project further.
